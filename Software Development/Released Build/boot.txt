This is where I am keeping my notes for trying to run this script on startup.


SOLUTION 1: Using cron tab.
I added this line to cron tab:
@reboot /bin/python "/home/aperture/Documents/PortalGunProjector/Software Development/Released Build/launch.py" &

This works for when I boot into CLI. But...I can't ctrl+C to close the application. The only way to boot to a terminal is to switch HDMI ports which crashes my audio playback in my python script.
This doesn't show up when I boot into desktop. I think it's executing before a window manager is running.

Maybe I can try a delay with cron tab. Like this: @reboot /bin/sleep 600 ; /path/to/your/your_program

SOLUTION 2: Using rc.local File
This resulted in some very strange bootup for both CLI and Desktop, I do not reccomend this.

SOLUTION 3: Using a .desktop File
This works well when using the desktop interface but doesn't work with the CLI.

SOLUTION 4: Using a .service File
Haven't tried yet.
